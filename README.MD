# About

This is a forked version of the cpca project (https://github.com/DQinYuan/chinese_province_city_area_mapper). 

# Purpose

cpca has stopped maintenance since 2021. We encountered several problems during using cpca.  
Some of the problems are:  

1. Inaccessible map data.  
cpca uses the map patches from openstreetmap.org, which can not be accessed now.

2. Two few style configurations.   
cpca doesnot expose enough parameters to configure the map styles. e.g., `draw_locations()`, `echarts_draw()` and `echarts_cata_draw()` cannot set background and marker colors.


In this repo, we try to revise and fix the above issues.
